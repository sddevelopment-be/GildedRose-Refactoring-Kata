# Progress on Gilded Rose

## Safety Net
 Convert tests to ensure the "requirements/desires" are met before we start making a mess of things.
    
- [ ] Convert existing test suite into an automated one
- [ ] Add exploratory tests -> NULLPOINTER suspicions 

## Change the code


# Code smells
- No way to add inventory after the Inn has been created
- "No default item can have a quality of more than 50" 
    -> not ensured by the code. Test and fix if needed.
